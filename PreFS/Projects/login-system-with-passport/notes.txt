# Dependencies..
$ npm install express ejs

# For development..
$ npm i --save-dev nodemon dotenv


$ npm install bcrypt        # for comparing and hashing the passwords..

------------
Checking and validating the user-details is not so complex, but making it work it for every field, need some more involvement.
So, will be using *Passport.js* for that..
$npm i passport
       passport-local   # The local version allows us to use usernames, passwords for loggin it.. and it also has ways like Google, facebook..
       express-session  # In order to persist the user across, need a session for that.
       express-flash    # To display messages like ""Failure:...". Even the passport uses it internally, for wrong-email, pwd...
-----------------

In order to logout, need to call via DELETE method, but its not supported by <form>. So...
$ npm i method-override     # This allows us to override the methods, as instead of using POST can use DELETE
